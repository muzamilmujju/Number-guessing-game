# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game (Tkinter)

This is a simple **GUI-based Number Guessing Game** built using Python's `tkinter` module.

The game randomly picks a number between **1 and 10**, and the player has to guess it correctly. The game gives hints if the guess is too high or too low.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The game generates a secret number between 1 and 10.
- The user enters a guess in the input box.
- The game gives feedback:
  - "Too low" if the guess is less than the secret number.
  - "Too high" if the guess is more than the secret number.
  - Shows a success message when the guess is correct and ends the game.
